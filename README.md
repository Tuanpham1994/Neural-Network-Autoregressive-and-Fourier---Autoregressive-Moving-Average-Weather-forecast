# Neural-Network-Autoregressive-and-Fourier---Autoregressive-Moving-Average-Weather-forecast
In this thesis, Random forest imputation and Box-Cox transformation were used for data preprocessing.
Seasonal & Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) was used for data decomposition.
Dynamic Harmonic Regression using Fourier Terms (F-ARMA) and Neural Network Autoregressive for weather time series data prediction.
Weather data: Wind speed, wave height, wind energy at different granularity.
